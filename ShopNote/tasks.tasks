Rough Outline:
  - Options page workable:
    - Layout jumps while logging in and retrieving notes
    - Need to show "Retrieving Notes" while the progress bar fills up 
    - Need so save the key for the selected note
  - Further work:
    - Content Scripts somehow need to access the credentials/note key information 
    - Show a modal dialog in the content scripts informing the user what is uploaded and showing the progress
